# Self Service Password Reset

## Overview

The Self-Service Password Reset (SSPR) tool is being offered as one of the enhancements associated with the new Self-Service Employee Center for City of Chicago employees. Using Microsoft Entra ID (Azure AD) Self-Service Password Reset (SSPR) portal, users will no longer need to call the IT service desk or contact an administrator to reset their password.

The enclosed instructions will highlight the steps required to successfully set up the platform necessary to allow end-users to securely change their password whether logged in to the network or outside of it.

## Introduction

A couple of essential steps are required to set up a secure platform necessary for you to change or reset your password.  The installation of specific applications or access to links respective to these steps have been set forth and approved by the City’s Information Security Office and should be adhered to mitigate security risks.

Consequently, the mobile “Microsoft Authenticator” is the preferred application and should be installed on all City-owned devices.   Next, you must register the application to the City’s account.  Once this has been completed you can gain access to the Microsoft Entra ID (Azure AD) self-service password reset (SSPR) tool to change or reset your password.

### What is Microsoft Entra ID Active Directory (Azure AD) self-service password reset (SSPR)?

Self-service password reset (SSPR) gives users the ability to change or reset their password with no administrator or help desk involvement. If a user's account is locked or they forget their password, they can follow prompts to unblock themselves and get back to work. This ability reduces help desk calls and loss of productivity when a user cannot sign into their device or an application.

### What is the Microsoft Authenticator application and what is it used for?

The Microsoft Authenticator registration process establishes the method of verification to enable end-users to independently reset their password.  The Microsoft Authenticator application helps end-users sign into their account(s) using two-step verification. Two-step verification helps you to use your accounts more securely because passwords can be forgotten, stolen, or compromised.
